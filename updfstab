# name: /etc/dev.d/default/updfstab.dev
# version: 7
# purpose: automatic handling of /etc/fstab for usb_storage devices under kernel 2.6 with udev
# This script is automatically called by udevd at each plug/unplug event of an usb device.
# It adds a line in /etc/fstab for each usb_storage device found,
# with a pretty name as mountpoint. (based on label or info read from /sys)
# it takes three environment variables as input : ACTION, DEVNAME and DEVPATH
# These variables are provided by udevd
